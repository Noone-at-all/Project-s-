Project-s-
==========

Okay, we still need a GUI, I have the mechanics handled.
Guise, a project!
Game of life?

Implemented so far:
	mechanics, says dav

TODO:
	comment dav's crazy code so that we can tell what the heck it all does
	It's not crazy, you just weren't involed.
	GUI, or rather, curses-based CLI
	Need to be methods of Board: PresentBoard(), MakeBoard(x, y), DrawGrid(grid), grid = []
	Need to be methods of Cell: ShouldBeLiving(x, y), CountLN(x, y), CellsDict = {}
